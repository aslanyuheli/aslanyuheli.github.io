            <h2>Santa Monica Methane Seep 2023 Photomosaics and Seafloor Characterization</h2>
            <p> In this project, we reconstructed the bathymetrics of seafloor around Santa Monica Seep in California, Los Angeles, using high resolution RGB images collected through ROV Alvin and AUV Sentry during research expedition AT50-12.
                We further quantified the potential methane volume around the seep based on seafloor landcovers classified through ENVI and ArcGIS Pro deep learning tools. With the use of sports cameras for data collection and photogrammeetry
                technology for image processing, we aim to suggest a potential trend towards low-cost, efficient method of aquatic data acquisition using GNSS instruments. 
            </p>
            <p> We presented updated progress of this project at AGU 2024 and SoCal Geobio Symposium</p>
