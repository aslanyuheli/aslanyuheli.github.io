            <p> This project was conducted in Manu National Park, Peru. In this project, we collected more than 70 sets of undulated tinamou calls from two playback experiments, and analyzed
                how eco-tourist noise can potentially impact the calling behaviors of tinamous. The bio-accoustics analysis was completed in Raven Pro.
            </p>
            <p> We presented updated progress of this project at UCLA Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Symposium, 2023</p>
