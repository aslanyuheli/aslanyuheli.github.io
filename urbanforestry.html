            <h2>From urban core to periphery: the impacts of flash droughts on urban forestry resilience in Northeast U.S. and related socioeconomic inequities</h2>
            <p>
            The world is experiencing a drastic paradigm transition from conventional, long-term droughts to rapidly developing flash droughts. This trend is leading to unprecedented ecological, food security, and public health risks in cities, where over half of the worldâ€™s population resides. <br><br>
            Using high spatial and temporal resolution data from MODIS and Landsat, combined with hydrological data from Gridmet, I am investigating how flash droughts are impacting the resilience and resistance of urban forests in Northeast U.S. cities of varying sizes. This research explores how resilience is shaped by rapid urban development and what this implies for potential inequities in urban ecosystem services.
