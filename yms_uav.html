            <h2>UAV Multispectral and LiDAR CHM based classification of Yale Myers Forest Type</h2>
            <p> This is a course project finished under the supervision of Professor Xuhui Lee. The study site involves part of the secondary, human-disturbed forest at Yale Myers. The aim of this project was to explore applications of drone-based multispectral imaging technology for informing and improving forest management in mixed-conifer forests of northern Connecticut. Specifically, our research questions were: 
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        How does reflectance value detection compare – band-by-band (blue, green, red, Near-Infrared and red edge) – between drone-captured imagery and satellite imagery captured at various resolutions?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How to best improve forest type classifications based on integrated multispectral and LiDAR CHM models?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
